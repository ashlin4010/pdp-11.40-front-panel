Cutlines – Black
Fill engraving – Red
Line engraving – Blue

3mm MDF

I have no idea if I've created the file correctly some tweaking might be required.

I have probably not got the Fill engraving correct but it's not important, its only an aesthetic choice.


Most importantly I don't know if I have the dimensions correct, please verify them against dimensions.png
