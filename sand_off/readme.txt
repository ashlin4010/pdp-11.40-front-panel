This folder contains files to create the stand offs that hold the front panel.


Original:
The original standoff was brass with a male and female thread, both are the same thread (#6-32 x.38)

Replacement screws can be found here: https://www.digikey.co.nz/en/products/detail/essentra-components/020632A050/9677359


Replacements:
My system was missing one of the standoff so I printed a replacement. The female thread is M3 and the male thread is a #6-32 x.38 nylon screw cut down and glued into the plastic.


New Part:
The new standoffs are simply two female M3 brass inserts pressed into some 3D printed parts.
